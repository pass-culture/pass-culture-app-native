## Installation - iOS

**After setting up your [environment](./setup.md)**, you can follow the steps below to run the **pass Culture** mobile application on iOS.

### Further installation process

If you encounter errors during this setup, refer to the Troubleshooting section at the end of this document.

- **install iOS dependencies**

  - Now you can install CocoaPods in the project `pass-culture-app-native`, that will install the gems, with:

  ```sh
  bundle install
  ```

  ```sh
  cd ios
  bundle exec pod install
  cd ..
  ```

  you may be asked to run:

  ```sh
  cd ios
  bundle exec pod repo update
  cd ..
  ```

If `bundle exec pod install` didn't work, check in Xcode -> Settings -> Locations if you have a Command line tools installed, then revalidate the Command line tools by clicking it.

- **install jq for some xcode scripts**

  ```sh
  brew install jq
  ```

### üî• Firebase setup

You will need to add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios` directory. You can get a copy of the testing configuration one through the password manager, or directly through the Firebase console inside `Project Settings`.

### üî®Setup Xcode

In order to launch the app in the Simulator or on your external Apple device, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create an [Apple Developer passCulture account](https://developer.apple.com/)

2. You need to [install](https://xcodereleases.com) the [version specified in `XCODE_SUPPORTED_VERSION`](../../scripts/check_xcode_version.sh)

3. Install a simulator if not already in Xcode

4. Download the iOS certificates to your computer:

   1. Connect to the Apple Developer account with Xcode.
   1. Get invited to the Apple Developer group by an Admin.
   1. Download the private key via fastlane:

      ```sh
      bundle exec fastlane ios download_certificates --env testing
      ```

   1. When required (multiple times), use the git ssh URL of the [private certificates repository](https://github.com/pass-culture/pass-culture-app-native-certificates)
   1. Get the `match repo passphrase` on [Keeper in the "Tech" vault](https://keepersecurity.eu/vault/#detail/saH6X4El4qtxQQIDI4AzcQ).

   1. It might ask your session password twice to continue, it might also ask you to do the previous step twice.

### üöÄ Run the app with yarn

- For Apple External Device

  Connect your device to the computer and run:

  ```sh
  yarn ios:testing --device
  ```

  or use the Xcode interface. Choose a scheme (like testing), then a device and click the `Run` button in the toolbar.

- For Xcode Simulator

  Run:

  ```sh
  yarn ios:testing
  ```

  or use the Xcode interface.

  This will also start the metro server. If not, run in another tab:

  ```sh
  yarn start
  ```

### üò§ Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>env: node: No such file or directory
  Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code</summary>

If this error pops up while trying to build with Xcode it means that Xcode can‚Äôt find Node because the sym-link to Node is not made.

#### First option

Run¬†`ln -s "\$(which node)" /usr/local/bin/node`

If it says ‚ÄúFile exists‚Äù,¬†`rm /usr/local/bin/node`¬†and rerun the command above.

Drawback ‚ùå: This sym-link will be obsolete as soon as the path of your node instance changes. To prevent this, you can command above to your .bashrc. Thus, the command will be run each time you open a new terminal

#### Second option

Add node with brew: `brew install node`

Drawback ‚ùå: If you were using a node version manager (nvm, fnm, ...) you will now have two different node instances

  <summary>‚ùå error: An organization slug is required (provide with --org)</summary>

This error means that the ~/.sentryclirc file has not been added correctly. Please run through [this tutorial again](https://github.com/pass-culture/pass-culture-app-native/blob/master/doc/installation/sentry.md#-configure-sentry-cli)

<details>
  <summary><strong>After the `bundle exec fastlane ios download_certificates --env testing` command, you gave the SSH [git repository](https://github.com/pass-culture/pass-culture-app-native-certificates) and it's not doing anything.</strong></summary>
It might be an issue with your ssh (for example if you only cloned the repository through http)
  
1. Try to clone the repository elsewhere using ssh to see if your ssh key is working if it does try again the command.

1. If it's still failing, save your ssh key password in the ssh agent :

   ```sh
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

   then try again.

Try to change the openssl version you're on:

```sh
openssl version
```

if it's not 1.1:

```sh
brew install openssl@1.1
```

```sh
brew unlink openssl@3
```

```sh
brew link openssl@1.1
```

check if the link worked:

```sh
brew link openssl@1.1
```

#### Pods may need to be installed again

```bash
$ cd ios && rm -rf ./build && rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
```
