## Installation - setup

### Install global tools

#### Install `nix` package manager

If you have a pass Culture's computer, which has a proxy that adds a custom certificate, the install may fail.

In that case, you will need to install Nix as follows :

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install  --ssl-cert-file '/Library/Application Support'/*/*/data/*cacert.pem
```

_If you want more information or if you have a problem you can consult [`nix` package manager installation](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer#the-determinate-nix-installer)._

#### Install DirEnv

1. Install the executable

   ```sh
   brew install direnv
   ```

   _If you want more information or if you have a problem you can consult [DirEnv installation](https://direnv.net/)._

2. You will need to add [hook into your user configuration (example: `~/.zshrc`)](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html).

3. Start a new terminal to load the new configuration.

### Load project environment

```sh
cd ./pass-culture-app-native # if needed
direnv allow
```

The last step can take several tens of minutes, especially the first time.

🚨 If you got an error when executing `direnv allow` run it twice 🚨

### IOS and Android setup

We advise to **follow [the guidelines](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment)** to set up your environment by selecting your Development OS and your target OS (Android/iOS).

#### Android

### Test setup

To make sure your environment is set up correctly, try to run a template application with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app) or with [react-native-cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).
