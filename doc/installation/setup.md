## Installation - setup

We advise to follow [the guidelines][1] to setup your environment. Select your Development OS and your target OS (Android/iOS).

### Android

For Android, you will need to:

- install `node`, `JDK`
- install Android Studio & Android SDK
- configure `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable
- create an virtual device with Android AVD.

### iOS

For iOS, you will need to:

- install `node`
- install Xcode and its command line tools
- Install a simulator if not already in Xcode
- install Cocoapods

### Test setup

To make sure your environment is setup correctly, try to run a template application with [Create React Native App][2] or with [react-native-cli][3].
