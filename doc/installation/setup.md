## Installation - setup

We advise to **follow [the guidelines](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)** to set up your environment by selecting your Development OS and your target OS (Android/iOS).

You'll also need `jq`:

**MacOS**

```sh
brew install jq
```

**Linux with apt as root**

```sh
apt update && apt -y install jq
```

**Building from source (not recommended)**

Read [jq documentation](https://github.com/stedolan/jq)

### Android

Follow the steps [here](/doc/installation/android.md).

### iOS

Follow the steps [here](/doc/installation/ios.md).

### Test setup

To make sure your environment is set up correctly, try to run a template application with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app) or with [react-native-cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).
