## Installation - Android

**After setting up your [environment](./setup.md)**, you can follow the steps below to run the **pass Culture** mobile application on Android.

### Further installation process

If you encounter errors during this setup, refer to the Troubleshooting section at the end of this document.

First download Android Studio :

```sh
brew install --cask android-studio
```

Then open [the folder `android`](./android/) in Android Studio.

Finally, open the Android Virtual Devices Manager and select (or create) a Virtual Device with the android version you want to run.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Code signing

- Download `testing.keystore` and `testing.keystore.properties` files from our password manager and place it inside the `/android/keystores` directory.

  _If you do not find `testing.keystore`, contact an admin._

- Modify `testing.keystore.properties` to match with this configuration (required in `build.gradle`) :

  ```
  keyAlias=passculture
  storeFile=testing.keystore
  storePassword=
  keyPassword=
  ```

- Do the same for staging and production.

### Install

In the `.env.local` file (create the file if not exists), add

```sh
SECRET_KEYTOOL_PASSWORD=THE_PASSWORD # replace THE_PASSWORD with the one from our password manager search for "Android keytool password"
```

then in your terminal run :

```sh
sudo xcodebuild -license # read and accept Apple license to be abble to use git inside Android Studio
./scripts/install_certificate_java.sh # this script ask root password
direnv reload
```

If it fails [see troubleshooting](./setup.md#troubleshooting)

### üî• Firebase setup

Download the `google-services.json` files from our password manager and place them inside the `android/app/src/<env>` directories. You can also download these files from the Firebase console.

```txt
android/
    app/
        src/
            production/
                google-services.json
            staging/
                google-services.json
            apptesting/
                google-services.json
```

### üöÄ Run the app

To run the app, simply run:

```sh
yarn android:testing
```

This will also start the metro server. If not, run in another tab :

```sh
yarn start
```

1. Check "Google APIs `*` System Image"

   Where `*` match you CPU architecture that you can know using the following command in the terminal

   ```sh
   uname -m
   ```

   Example: `Google APIs ARM 64 v8a System Image`

   This type of image is known to work unlike to "Google APIs **ATD**" or "Google Play" which are known to have issues

1. Click on "OK", this will download stuff

#### Create an emulator

1. Open Android Studio
1. Open Device Manager
1. Click on "Add a new device"

   ```

### Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>No value has been specified for property 'manifestOutputDirectory'</strong></summary>

In Android Studio: File > Settings > Experimental > Gradle -> uncheck "Only sync the active variant" checkbox.

If you encounter an issue with JDK, install using `brew install --cask temurin@17` and add the path `JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-17.jdk/Contents/Home` in .zshrc

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Version conflict</strong></summary>

It happens when you try to install with a build number _lower_ than the one already installed.

- Ensure that there is one

```bash
$ yarn run-android | grep 'INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE'
```

- If no line containing `'INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE'` is caught, this is not the problem
- If a line with `'INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE'` is caught
‚Üí **Uninstall the app on your emulator before building**

  <summary><strong>General error for building the app on Android Studio</strong></summary>

<details>
  <summary><strong>[M1 & M2 processor] Error while building the app on android with Android Studio : `Android Studio-- Cause: error=86, Bad CPU type in executable` or `Task :app:processApptestingDebugResources FAILED`</strong></summary>

If you get this error on M1 or M2 Mac, installing Rosetta 2 should solve the issue. You can install it with this command : `softwareupdate --install-rosetta`.

Rosetta will allow applications requiring Intel processor to run on M1 & M2 Mac.
