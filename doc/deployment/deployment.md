## ⚙️ Deployment process

See [notion documentation][1] for more information.

We use 3 environments for the mobile application: `testing` > `staging` > `production`.

There are two types of deployments: **soft** and **hard**:

- a **soft** deployment is for most of the time, when only the javascript code has changed
- a **hard** deployment is required if the native code has changed:
  - environment variable changed or new
  - new native library
  - new build step
  - ...

### Testing

You can review & download the **testing** apps on Appcenter for [iOS][2] & [Android][3] of using this [url][4].

#### ⚡️ Soft deploy (automatic)

Most of the time, when developing a feature, you probably didn't change the native code: if you changed only javascript code, the deployment to the testing application will be **automatic** on CircleCI (see `deploy-soft-testing` job).

Then the build is faster as only the javascript code is published. The download and installation of the modification will be automatic when you open the app.

##### Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>I don't see my changes on testing</summary>

If you don't see your changes, try to check if the codepush was correctly downloaded. To do so go to "CheatCodes", and click on the "check update" button.

3 possibilities:

- it displays "no update found": you are up to date
- it shows "New version available on AppCenter" you need to go to hyperurl.co/pc-testing
- it download the update and restart the app

#### Hard deploy (manual)

If I modified native code, I need to hard deploy:

- `yarn trigger:testing:deploy:patch`

This will bump the patch number, create a tag `testing_vX.X.X+1` and push it.
CircleCI will detect the tag and launch the lanes `deploy-android-testing-hard` & `deploy-ios-testing-hard` (see `.circleci/config.yml` file).

### Staging (MES)

You can review & download the **staging** apps on Appcenter for [iOS][5] & [Android][6] of using this [url][7].

#### Hard deploy (once a week, manual)

When you want to deploy the current version of the `release` branch in staging, you can run the following commands:

- `yarn trigger:staging:deploy`

This will bump the `minor` version, create a tag `vX.X+1.X` and push it.

- or `trigger:staging:deploy:patch`

This will bump the `patch` version, create a tag `vX.X.X+1` and push it.
CircleCI will detect the tag `vX.X.X` and launch the lanes `deploy-ios-staging-hard` & `deploy-android-staging-hard` (see `.circleci/config.yml` file)

### Production (MEP)

#### Hard deploy (when MEP wanted, manual)

- Know which version (and then tag) you want to deploy

- `yarn trigger:production:deploy <tag>`

This will create a tag `prod-hard-deploy`. CircleCI will detect the tag and launch the lane `deploy-android-production-hard` & `deploy-ios-production-hard` (see `.circleci/config.yml` file)

### Hotfix

#### When

⚠️ Only if there is a bug really urgent in production, that we need to fix very quickly.
If not urgent, it is better to release a new version.

#### How

- List all tags of the version `X.X.X`, tags of type: `vX.X.X-Y` (`git fetch --tag`and then `git tag`)
- Checkout on the tag with the biggest Y (if no tag with Y, checkout on `vX.X.X`)
- Cherry-pick all the commits of the feature `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`
- ⚠️ do not update package.json version number for a code push (the code push targets only one version)
- check if tests are OK `yarn test`
- `git tag vX.X.X-(Y+1)`
- `git tag hotfix-staging-vX.X.X-(Y+1)`
- `git push origin hotfix-staging-vX.X.X-(Y+1)`: this will deploy it to `staging`
- `git push origin vX.X.X-(Y+1)`
- Validate the fix with the PO on staging app (version X.X.X)
- If it is OK for the PO, deploy it to production:
- `git tag hotfix-production-vX.X.X-(Y+1)`
- `git push origin hotfix-production-vX.X.X-(Y+1)`: this will deploy it to `production`
- ⚠️ check your code push targets the actual production version (one code push targets only one version)
- ⚠️ Do not forget to create a pull request from your branch to `master` and `release` to retrieve fixes on these branches

#### Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>I don't see my codepush on staging/prod app</summary>
  
Check if you can find it on AppCenter. Example for [staging iOS][8].
