# **E2E Testing**

We use Webdriver.IO as automation framework to test our Web and mobile application.

## **Appium**

To run app and browser tests on Mobile, you need to run an appium server.

To install appium:

```bash
npm i -g appium@next
```

You will also need the following plugins:

```bash
# Android mobile and browser testing
appium driver install uiautomator2
# iOS mobile testing
appium driver install xcuitest
# iOS browser testing
appium driver install safari
```

Android Google Chrome browser version depend on the Android platform.
You must provide the `chromedriver` specific to your Android device (this can be checked in the google chrome package information of your device).

You can read more on : https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

For Mac user when you downloaded the version adapted at your Chrome you can extract it and use this command : `mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin`

To install the chromedriver of your choice:

```bash
# Android browser chrome testing
npm install --chromedriver_version="$CHROMEDRIVER_VERSION"
```

For running mobile (iOS or Android) tests, you can start appium server manually (otherwise, use a gui tools listed below):

```bash
appium --relaxed-security --allow-cors
```

In case of problem, there is a useful tool called `appium-doctor`, you can install and run it as follow:

```bash
npm install @appium/doctor --location=global
appium-doctor
```

---

## **Peer dependencies**

On your desktop, you must install browser's driver that match your version in order to use test automation, respectively:

- `chromedriver` for Chrome (For Mac users: `brew install cask chromedriver`)
- `safaridriver` for Safari
- `geckodriver` for Firefox (For Mac users: `brew install geckodriver`)

Refer to google to get installation instruction for your system.

## **App center**

If you want to download apps from AppCenter, you can create an user API token in Account => Account Settings => User API tokens
You can name it APPCENTER_USER_API_TOKEN

---

## **Configuration**

We use environment variable to customize the configuration:

| Environment variable             | Type      | Required | Default                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

For instance, if you wish to run test for a different android emulator:

```bash
API_BASE_URL=${API_BASE_URL} \
ANDROID_DEVICE_NAME=emulatorxyz \
ANDROID_PLATFORM_VERSION=10 \
yarn e2e:android.app
```

Or if you wish to test http://127.0.0.1:3000:

```bash
API_BASE_URL=${API_BASE_URL} \
WDIO_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3000 \
yarn e2e:android.browser
```

### **Android emulator vs iOS simulator network**

Android `127.0.0.1` map to its own interface, while `10.0.2.2` target your `127.0.0.1`.
iOS simulator use the same interface as your host, it is fine to use `127.0.0.1`.

You can view all available options in [`e2e/config/environment/env.ts`](../../e2e/config/environment/env.ts).

###  **Gmail Client**

In order to login to the e2e mailbox, you must have in the root of the repository one of these two files:

- `credentials.json`: OAuth2 client (require interactive login)
- `token.json`: OAuth2 Gmail API JWT (can be generated if you have `credentials.json`)

**Each of them must be in your `PATH` system**

---

## **Services dependencies**

We use an isolated backend service that doesn't depend on any environment, for this reason you must run 3 services:

- redis
- postgres
- pcapi (must use port `6001`)

We use `docker-compose` to start those service.

### **Why fixed Port?**

App Native e2e tests expect you to use `.env.staging` or `.env.testing` environment/conf.
During e2e tests, the app native api client will automatically switch to use the e2e backend.

### **Generate env file for configuring the pc-api service**

First, you need to generate pc-api configuration using `./e2e/generate-env.sh` script.

```bash
SENDINBLUE_API_KEY=${SENDINBLUE_API_KEY} \
END_TO_END_TESTS_EMAIL_ADDRESS=${END_TO_END_TESTS_EMAIL_ADDRESS} \
./e2e/generate-env.sh
```

> `SENDINBLUE_API_KEY` and `END_TO_END_TESTS_EMAIL_ADDRESS` are secrets available in 1password.

For Android emulator, since `127.0.0.1` is mapped to its own interface, we must use `10.0.2.2` address to reach pcapi running on our localhost.

If you want to test with an **Android emulator**, you will need to set `ANDROID=true` and generate a new env file, ex:

```bash
SENDINBLUE_API_KEY=${SENDINBLUE_API_KEY} \
END_TO_END_TESTS_EMAIL_ADDRESS=${END_TO_END_TESTS_EMAIL_ADDRESS} \
ANDROID=true \
./e2e/generate-env.sh
```

### **To start all the containers**

If you are not already logged in to Google Cloud using command line you need to login using the following commands :

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev
gcloud auth login
```

This will open a window where you can login using your pass Culture account.

Then, to start all the containers, using the `staging` pcapi version for example:

```bash
PCAPI_DOCKER_TAG=$(curl -sS https://backend.staging.passculture.team/health/api) \
docker-compose -f e2e/docker-compose-e2e.yml up
```

Or, to start all the containers using the latest `testing` pcapi version for example:

```bash
PCAPI_DOCKER_TAG=$(curl -sS https://backend.testing.passculture.team/health/api) \
docker-compose -f e2e/docker-compose-e2e.yml up
```

> Set `PCAPI_DOCKER_TAG` to any valid tag. Each commit of main correspond to tag, as well as commit from PRs.

### **To stop all the containers**

```bash
PCAPI_DOCKER_TAG=$(curl -sS https://backend.staging.passculture.team/health/api) \
docker-compose -f e2e/docker-compose-e2e.yml stop
```

### **To remove all the containers**

```bash
PCAPI_DOCKER_TAG=$(curl -sS https://backend.staging.passculture.team/health/api) \
docker-compose -f e2e/docker-compose-e2e.yml stop && \
docker-compose -f e2e/docker-compose-e2e.yml rm -fv
```

---

## **Testing on Android**

Two options, either the application is already installed, or you have to provide an apk

### **Provide an apk**

You can use an apk, either from appcenter, either one created by building locally.

- To download an `apk` from appcenter, you can do use `yarn appcenter:install`
- Set environment variable `ANDROID_PLATFORM_VERSION` to match your Android platform version of your device.
- You must have a running emulator or physical device available when running `adb devices`

To build application:

```bash
# assembleStagingRelease or assembleApptestingRelease
ANDROID_GRADLE_TASK=assembleStagingRelease
./android/gradlew ${ANDROID_GRADLE_TASK} -p android

# you can now run tests
APPIUM_APP=./android/app/build/outputs/apk/staging/release/app-staging-release.apk \
API_BASE_URL=${API_BASE_URL} \
END_TO_END_TESTS_EMAIL_ADDRESS=${END_TO_END_TESTS_EMAIL_ADDRESS} \
yarn e2e:android.app
```

### **Using already installed application**

If the application is already installed, you can test it without providing an apk to install, for instance, for staging app you will do:

```bash
API_BASE_URL=${API_BASE_URL} \
END_TO_END_TESTS_EMAIL_ADDRESS=${END_TO_END_TESTS_EMAIL_ADDRESS} \
APPIUM_APP_PACKAGE="app.passculture.staging" \
APPIUM_APP_ACTIVITY="com.passculture.MainActivity" \
yarn e2e:android.app
```

It will use capability `appium:noReset` to `true`, read more here: https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-driver#general

---

## **Testing on iOS**

- It is not possible to use the `ipa` from appcenter.
- You must use a iOS simulator.
- You must have environment variables `IOS_PLATFORM_VERSION` and `IOS_DEVICE_NAME` that match your device and platform version.
- You must create a test build.
- Simulator must be started and available, see `xcrun simctl list devices`.

To build application:

```bash
cd ios
scheme=PassCulture-Staging
xcodebuild -workspace PassCulture.xcworkspace -scheme ${scheme} -sdk iphonesimulator -configuration Release
last_build_dir=$(ls -tr  ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ | grep PassCulture | tail -n1)
ditto -ck --sequesterRsrc --keepParent ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/${last_build_dir}/Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator/PassCulture.app ../PassCulture.zip
cd ..

# you can now run tests
APPIUM_APP=./PassCulture.zip yarn e2e:ios.app
```

> It is not possible to test the iOS application using the development environment (because you cannot erase application cache on iOS, re-running test will fail due to FirstLaunch requirements).

If the application is already installed, you can inspect it (with Appium Inspector) without building the application. For instance, for staging app you will do:

```bash
# or for testing: app.passculture.test
APPIUM_APP="app.passculture.staging" yarn e2e:ios.app
```

---

## **Writing tests**

We have two types of tests: `app` and `browser`

- `app` is the native application, it runs on iOS or Android
- `browser` is the Web application, it runs on Desktop, iOS and Android browsers
- A test file is called a `suite`, test within a suite are run in their **order of declaration**
- Unless it can only succeed, do not use mocha `before` hook because failure in it won't be considered as a test failure, thus no tests will be reported as failed, instead use a flip variable as in this example:

```ts
import FirstLaunch from '../helpers/FirstLaunch'
import { TabBar } from '../features/navigation/TabBar'
import { didFirstLaunch } from '../helpers/utils/error'

describe('TabBar', () => {
  let ok = false
  let tabBar: TabBar

  before(async () => {
    const theme = getTheme(await browser.getWindowSize())
    tabBar = new TabBar(theme)
  })

  it('should first launch app', async () => {
    ok = await FirstLaunch.init(tabBar)
  })

  it('should click on search', async () => {
    didFirstLaunch(ok)
    await tabBar.search.click()
  })
})
```

---

## **GUI Tools**

You can try those:

- GUI inspector for mobile apps: https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector/releases
- Server with GUI in replacement: https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases
- Alternative GUI inspector for mobile apps: https://digital.ai/products/continuous-testing/appium-studio/

---

## **Convention**

We usually write cross platforms tests (for both `app` and `browser`),
but we also support `app` or `browser` specific tests.

Use the following file name convention:

- `app` and `browser`: `*.spec.ts`
- `app`: `*.app.spec.ts`
- `browser`: `*.browser.spec.ts`

---

## **Utils**

This is the documentation of selector: https://webdriver.io/docs/selectors/#accessibility-id

We also have a useful cross platforms selector:

```ts
find('Accueil') // to retrieve one element (the first one in the DOM on Web)
// or
findAll('Accueil') // to retrieve list of elements (sorted by order of appearance in the DOM on Web)
```

Is equivalent to, on `app` (iOS and Android):

```ts
$('~Acceuil') // to retrieve one element (the first one in the DOM on Web)
// or
$$('~Acceuil') // to retrieve list of elements (sorted by order of appearance in the DOM on Web)
```

and `browser`:

```ts
$('[data-testid="Accueil"]')  // to retrieve the first one in the DOM
// or
$$('[data-testid="Accueil"]') // to retrieve list of elements (sorted by order of appearance in the DOM)
```

We could have used `flags.isWeb` to decide which one to use, but this is exactly what does `find`
and this allow to write less verbose selector for our cross platforms cases.

### **~ Selector**

The selector used to access component is the `accessibility id` :

- For Android: the `accessibility id` corresponds to the `accessibilityLabel`
- For iOS: the `accessibility id` corresponds to the `testID`.

**We only want to use accessibility id selector, as this is the only way to have cross plateforme selectors.**

If this is not possible, you will have to write platform specific selectors within your e2e tests (for example, for our SetBirthDate, we use 4 different date pickers)

### **How to add cross platforms markers in the source code ?**

We have two utilities that can be used:

1. `accessibilityAndTestId`: utilities
2. `useE2eTestId`: react hook

(1) `accessibilityAndTestId` can be used as follows:

```tsx
function ExampleComponent() {
  return <MyComponent {...accessibilityAndTestId('Un texte unique')} />
}
```

Use `accessibilityAndTestId` only if you want `accessibilityLabel` to be set outside e2e execution, **it will then be read by screen readers**.

(2) `useE2eTestId` can be used as follows:

```tsx
function ExampleComponent() {
  const e2eTestId = useE2eTestId('Un texte unique')
  return <MyComponent {...e2eTestId} />
}
```

Use `useE2eTestId` hook only if you don't want `accessibilityLabel` to be set outside e2e execution, **it will never read by screen readers**.

**Some components already implement a cross-platform selector:**

- `AppButton`, `ButtonInsideText`, `ButtonWithLinearGradient`: The `accessibilityLabel` and `testID` are automatically set to the `wording` prop, or to `accessibilityLabel` prop if given. This means that `accessibility id` is the `wording` or `accessibilityLabel`, which allow us to have a cross-platform selector.
- `TouchableOpacity`, `Touchable`, `InternalTouchableLink`, `ExternalTouchableLink`: The `testID` is automatically set to the `accessibilityLabel` prop. This means that this element needs to have an `accessibilityLabel` if we want to have a cross-platform selector.

For more information on selectors, please check [this notion page](https://www.notion.so/passcultureapp/Documentation-E2E-S-lecteurs-42cd859559454454a3a4a37ef1e86f41).

**react-native-web**

All UI components imported from react-native, will have a `data-testid` attributes set if a `testID` is set, this is because `react-native-web` do it under the hood.

If you have a web only component, you will have to manually set the `data-testid` to it, or use the `accessibilityAndTestId` utils.

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Safari**

You might have this error when running `yarn e2e:browser.safari`:

```bash
ERROR webdriver: Request failed with status 500 due to session not created: Could not create a session: You must enable the ‘Allow Remote Automation’ option in Safari’s Develop menu to control Safari via WebDriver.
```

This can be solved by opening Safari, Develop Menu, then check `Allow Remote Automation`

### **Chrome**

This prompt may appear when running `yarn e2e:browser.chrome`:

> “chromedriver” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.

In order to authorize chromedriver to be opened, you need to go System Preferences > Security & Privacy and click "Open Anyway" to confirm your intent to open the app.
