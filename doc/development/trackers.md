# How to add a Firebase tracker

## Why

To have access to analytics we need trackers. In order to do so, we use Firebase to log when a event occurs in every user app. This standard explains how to implement a tracker on a button.

## Key points

1. Add Firebase event in your code (following alphabetical order)

   a. Add your event in [src/libs/firebase/analytics/events.ts](../../src/libs/firebase/analytics/events.ts)

   b. Add a function called `log<YourEvent>`in [src/libs/firebase/analytics/analytics.ts](../../src/libs/firebase/analytics/analytics.ts)

   c. Add a mock of your function in [src/libs/firebase/analytics/mocks/analytics.ts](src/libs/firebase/analytics/mocks/analytics.ts)

2. Call your analytics function in a callback before giving it as a props to your button

3. Test the behaviour in Firebase

   a. Open the Firebase console and go to the [DebugView](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/4/project/passculture-native/analytics/app/android:app.passculture/debugview)

   b. Find your device in the list (arm64 is for M1, x86_64 for regular macOS)
   b2. If you are connected, you can check your user ID in the debugView to match the one in your cheatcodes

   c. Find your event in the occuring event list (it could be a bit slow)

## Mistakes to avoid when following the standard

- Forget to create the mock, you will not be able to test that your function is called
- Not adding your event in the alphabetical order
- Look in the wrong debugging device, to avoid that, try to check other event when navigating on the app before
- Not accepting the app to track your informations during your first opening
