- [ ] Made sure my feature is working on mobile (depending on relevance : real or virtual devices)
- [ ] Written **unit tests** native (and web when implementation is different) for my feature.
- [ ] Added a **screenshot** for UI tickets or deleted the screenshot section if no UI change
- [ ] If my PR is a bugfix, I add the link of the "résolution de problème sur le bug" [on Notion][1]
