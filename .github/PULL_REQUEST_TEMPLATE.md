## Flakiness

If I had to re-run tests in the CI due to flakiness, I add the incident [on Notion][2]

## Checklist

I have:

- [ ] Made sure my feature is working on web.
- [ ] Made sure my feature is working on mobile (depending on relevance : real or virtual devices)
- [ ] Written **unit tests** native (and web when implementation is different) for my feature.
- [ ] Added a **screenshot** for UI tickets or deleted the screenshot section if no UI change
- [ ] If my PR is a bugfix, I add the link of the "résolution de problème sur le bug" [on Notion][1]

## Screenshots

**delete** _if no UI change_
